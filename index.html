        <h1>Correlation vs Causation</h1>
    
        <h3 class="code">What is correlation used for?</h3>
        
        <h4>Correlation is used to show that variables are <span style="color: #ECC9C7;">related</span>. Relationships between variables that are linear can be classified as correlations.</h4>
        
        <h3 class="code">What is the difference between correlation and causation?</h3>
        
        <h4>Correlation exists whenever two variables are related. This can be seen when one value increase when another increases, decreases when another decreases, or increases when the other decreases. Correlation only shows that a relationship exists between the two variables and can easily be proven with data. Causation, however, is not proven by correlation and can be harder to verify. </h4>

        <h4>Three ways that one could visually show relationships include <span class="important">smoothers, matrices and parallel coordinate plots, </span>and<span class="important"> regression.</span></h4>
